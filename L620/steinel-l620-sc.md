## Camera dismounting and hardware identification

Dismouting of Steinel Cameras is quite hard, and seems to don't be faisible without breaking a foot of the camera support. This confirm the need of developping a script to install a new firmware without need to open the camera.

### Steinel L620 SC camera is based on this hardware
- SoC : Hisilicon HI3518EV300
- Sensor : ??
- Wifi Card : Realtek RTL8188FU (to be confirme)
